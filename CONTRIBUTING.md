## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= v22.18.0)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SpeedRunLisk.git
   cd SpeedRunLisk
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d          # Start PostgreSQL database
   yarn drizzle-kit migrate      # Run database migrations
   yarn db:seed                  # Seed database with initial data
   yarn start                    # Start development server
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Style and Quality

- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Run linting before committing:
  ```bash
  yarn lint                     # Run ESLint
  yarn format                   # Format with Prettier
  yarn next:check-types         # TypeScript type checking
  ```

### Database Changes

When modifying the database schema:

1. Update the schema in `packages/nextjs/services/database/config/schema.ts`
2. Generate migration: `yarn drizzle-kit generate`
3. Apply migration: `yarn drizzle-kit migrate`
4. Commit both schema changes and migration files

### Testing

Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality:

```bash
# NextJS tests
yarn workspace @speedrun-lisk/nextjs test

# Smart contract tests
yarn hardhat:test
```

### Commit Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format when possible
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference related issues in commit messages

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them
3. Push to your fork and create a pull request
4. Ensure all CI checks pass
5. Request review from maintainers
