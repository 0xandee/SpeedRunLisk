# Week 4: Oracle + Sponsored UX

## Challenge Overview

Enhance your application with price oracles for real-world data OR implement gasless transactions for better user experience.

## Track A: Price Oracle Integration

### Requirements

- Integrate Chainlink price feeds or similar oracle
- Display real-time price data in your frontend
- Use price data in smart contract logic
- Handle oracle failures gracefully

### Example Use Cases

- Token price displays
- Dynamic NFT pricing based on ETH/USD
- Price-based game mechanics
- DeFi calculations with real market data

## Track B: Gasless Transactions (Sponsored UX)

### Requirements

- Implement meta-transactions or similar gasless solution
- Users can interact without holding ETH
- Sponsor pays gas fees for user actions
- Maintain security and prevent abuse

### Technical Options

- ERC-2771 meta-transactions
- Account abstraction
- Relayer services (Gelato, Biconomy)
- Custom sponsored transaction system

## Submission Requirements

- ✅ Choose ONE track (Oracle OR Gasless)
- ✅ Working demonstration in frontend
- ✅ Smart contract implementation
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases
- ✅ Documentation of chosen approach

## Success Tips

- Research your chosen track thoroughly
- Start with the simplest implementation
- Test edge cases (oracle failures, transaction failures)
- Consider user experience implications
- Document trade-offs and design decisions
